Hailing from a liberal arts background (East Asian Studies major), I had no prior experience in programming/computer science. Right after college, I moved to Japan to teach English for two years, but soon focused my energy on searching for a more challenging and rewarding career. Fortunately, my efforts paid off, and in 2012, I was accepted to Kyoto University's Graduate School of Informatics. This is an institution well known for its strong engineering program, and it is one of the most competitive schools in Japan. 

Although I completed my master's degree in late 2014, I knew that I needed to further deepen my knowledge of programming. Upon my return to the U.S., I began to take various online courses, avidly learning to program in languages such as Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, etc. From these experiences, I began to enjoy the process of problem solving while continually honing my coding skills. I particularly like the idea of dissecting a big project into smaller manageable subtasks, and then integrating the components back together. Using these skills, I hope to embark on a new career creating web applications that are creative, innovative, and robust.

It has been a few months since I started Learn, and I have to say it has been quite an adventure. Despite several frustrating moments throughout my learning experience, I have become less averse to error messages, seeing them as clues towards a working solution rather than as signs of failure. I look forward to the next few months as I complete the full stack development course.
